# Chemistry Glassware Simulation

## Overview

Simulation to familarize students with glassware

## Target Audiences

College-aged, general chemistry students

## Learning Objectives

- Students will be able to recognize and name more glassware.
- Be able to read glassware measurements correctly (meniscus, units)
- Can determine which wares should be used for specific scenarios - like if you want to get this amount of liquid, which tool would be better to use

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

- Take up water
    - Details: Use mouse in some way to get water into glassware. Actions for taking up the water for pipettes vs for other glassware would have to be different. Graphically  might be a bit tricky if the glassware not uniform shape.
    - _Note: Pipets use a pi-pump to draw the liquid up above the line, remove pump and place thumb or finger over the top, slowly release liquid until liquid sits right on the calibration line. Burets (and graduated pipets) need to have a starting point and an ending point recorded._
Burets (and graduated pipets) need to have a starting point and an ending point recorded.
- Weigh and determine volume
    - Details: Scale gives back a number once you put water in the glass on it. More precise glassware should have less variation in the numbers.
    - How it works: Scale readings can correspond to lines on the glass readings - or could be fixed with some randomness.
- Calc mass -> volume
    - Details: A notes section after the weighing with formulas and a guide to how to calc. Mention water tempurature and how to get density from it. 
    - How it works: Could autofill once everything is over or a fill in the blank type section

## Feedback

- Water level rising when you fill the glassware.
- Warnings to take water out if user poors way past target amount.
- Prompts to retry the "taking up water" section if user sets pipettes wrong.
- At end, tells user how close to expected amount.
